Supply Chain Problem Analysis & Dashboard

An analytical project focused on identifying inefficiencies and risks in supply chain operations. Using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI/Streamlit**, this project analyzes procurement, inventory, logistics, and supplier data to uncover key bottlenecks and recommend data-driven solutions.



 Project Overview

Supply chains are the backbone of any production and delivery system. When disrupted, they can cause major delays, increased costs, and customer dissatisfaction. This project investigates real-world supply chain data to:

- Detect delays and inventory shortages
- Analyze supplier performance
- Monitor logistics KPIs
- Improve overall supply chain visibility


Tools & Technologies

| Tool/Tech        | Purpose                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Python (Pandas)  | Data cleaning and transformation       |  |

 Sample KPIs Tracked

- On-time Delivery Rate
- Average Lead Time
- Inventory Turnover Ratio
- Stock-out Frequency
- Order Fulfillment Accuracy


Insights & Recommendations

Delays were highest in **Region X** due to supplier inconsistencies 

Inventory turnover improved after automation in **Warehouse Y*

A 20% drop in on-time deliveries during Q2 due to route disruptions 

Recommendation: switch to more reliable regional suppliers and optimize reordering policies
